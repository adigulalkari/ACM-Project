Hey I am Adi Gulalkari I am studying Computer Science with sp. in Data Science. I have started webdev recently and have found great fun doing it. 

Project Discription: <br>
This project helps you to keep the tabs on your income and expenses. You will be able to see the balance amount after every expenditure.
I have used browser localStorage to store the data that the user inputs.
The UI is quite simple and uses basic CSS. I can definite make many more changes to this code to make the page prettier. <br>
All sugetions are welcome.<br>
